def: "Any macromolecular complex composed of two or more polypeptide subunits, which may or may not be identical. Protein complexes may have other associated non-protein prosthetic groups, such as nucleotides, metal ions or carbohydrate groups." [GOC:go_curators]
comment: Note that although at some level almost all cellular components can be thought of as protein complexes, this term is intended to exclude structures composed of the same repeating subunit or subunits, for example microtubules. Protein complexes encompassed by this term are generally not structural, and usually have a defined set of subunits.

def: "An amino acid chain that is produced de novo by ribosome-mediated translation of a genetically-encoded mRNA." [PRO:DAN, PRO:WCB]
comment: Proteins descended from a common ancestor can be classified into families and superfamilies composed of products of evolutionarily-related genes. The domain architecture of a protein is described by the order of its constituent domains. Proteins with the same domains in the same order are defined as homeomorphic [PRO:WCB].
